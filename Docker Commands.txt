# Creating Docker Image
docker build -t welcome-app .

# Run That docker image as a container
Here we should give the host port and container port
docker run -p 5000:5000 welcome-app
(here will get one api)

# checking how many containers are running
docker ps

# Docker stop
docker stop container-id

# Next session is quite amazing
going to deploy this image in the docker hub repository, once he deployed, then we can pull this particular image, and run this particular docker image as a container, and we can access it your local machine

for pushing into the docker hub

docker login
give credentials

docker images

# Now i have to rename this particular docker image
docker image rm -f welcome-app

#The above command will remove the docker image
#Once this is removed, just do docker images, we will not able to find the docker image there.

#then important command

docker build -t krishnaik06/welcome-app .

give user name before and app name after, this is super important, automatic the build process will starting again, once the build will happen then we can see the new docker image with username

#Another way to change the docker image name
docker tag krishnaik06/welcome-app krishnaik06/welcome-app1

these are the two ways, how we rename the docker image from older name to new name.

Always make sure that, if you push the repository to the docker hub, make sure that, put your username on front of it.

#Docker push
docker push krishnaik06/welcome-app:latest

#here latest is nothing but it is a tag of docker images, when we run docker images we can able to find that tag in images.

Now our docker images was pushed, and the most interesting thing is that we can also download it and use it.

Now in docker hub, we can able to see our docker image in the docker hub, specifically with our username

now lets try to delete a docker image,
and pull it from docker hub and use it in our local machine

docker pull krishnaik06/welcome-app:latest

# Now our images was pulled, check docker images

# Now just run the pulled docker image,

docker run -p 5000:5000 krishnaik06/welcome-app:latest

# Running the pulled docker image in detach mode as well

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 krishnaik06/welcome-app:latest

it is done.

now in next session, he teached about docker compose.

why docker compose and why is that?
